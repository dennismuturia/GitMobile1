# GIT MOBILE
## Introduction
    This is basically a github app but the mobile version of an app.
    Not all times that a person will be having to carry around the 
    laptop to access github. So thats why I decided to include
    This mobile app. I used the github api provided whic is OAuth 
    authenticated to gain data.
